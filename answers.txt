What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Rebasing and merging technically do the same thing - technically. Merging is a non destructive operation - if a feature needs to be implemented from main into your branch. 
However, this means that everytime the main branch gets updated and the feature (other branch) needs to merge, a new merge request will be made. 
This in turn pollutes the branches history with all of the merge commits. Rebasing moves the feature branch to the end of main and makes all the new commits on main into the feature
branch. This is a lot cleaner when looking at the git history, and every change is linear. This is a positive as it unclutters the workspace but can be a problem if two users write 
in the same feature space (it is hard to decipher who did what). 




What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a server where code is stored. It serves as a 
centralized place where collaboraters can store their code, 
collaborate, push and pull their latest updates. Remote respositories 
allow for forking, 
branching, etc. and are a center for version control. Remote repisotory's 
can be a github repo, a local device's repo, a fork, etc.
