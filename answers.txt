What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Rebasing and merging technically do the same thing - technically. Merging 
is a non destructive operation - if a feature needs to be implemented from 
main into your branch. 
However, this means that everytime the main branch gets updated and the 
feature (other branch) needs to merge, a new merge request will be made. 
This in turn pollutes the branches history with all of the merge commits. 
Rebasing moves the feature branch to the end of main and makes all the new 
commits on main into the feature
branch. This is a lot cleaner when looking at the git history, and every 
change is linear. This is a positive as it unclutters the workspace but 
can be a problem if two users write 
in the same feature space (it is hard to decipher who did what).
